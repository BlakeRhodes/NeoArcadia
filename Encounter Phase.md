## Step 1: Regular Encounters  
  
- Roll 1d6 You may add or subtract your Scouting Bonus after rolling. If doing so would put your result above 6 or below 1 use the closest number instead.  
  
## Step 2: Resolve Encounter  
  
Encounters challenge the party and tax their resources. Sometimes it is better to avoid danger, but nothing risked nothing gained.   
  
Combat is common as the Ancient Future is a dangerous place. Use the [Combat System](./Combat%20System.html) to slay your foes!  
  
## Step 3: Special Encounters  
  
Some hexes have Special Encounters, these are encounters unique to the hex and have their own rules for resolution as recorded on the Hex Sheet.
