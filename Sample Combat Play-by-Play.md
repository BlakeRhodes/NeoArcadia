# Sample Combat Play-by-Play  
  
Our party consists of four members: a Fighter, a Rogue, a Priest, and a Hunter.  
  
### Scenario Setup  
  
- **Party Members:**  
  - Fighter: Combat Modifier +3  
  - Rogue: Combat Modifier +2  
  - Priest: Combat Modifier +0  
  - Hunter: Combat Modifier +2  
  
- **Encounter:** The party faces a group of goblins (Enemy Impact: 8).  
  
### Step 1: Calculate Party Impact  
  
- Party Impact = Fighter (+3) + Rogue (+2) + Priest (+0) + Hunter (+2) = +7  
  
### Step 2: Calculate Combat Modifier  
  
- Combat Modifier = Party Impact (+7) - Enemy Impact (8) = -1  
  
### Step 3: Edge Factor  
  
- Assume the party was ambushed (Surprise Disadvantage): Roll 1d6 instead of 2d6.  
  
### Step 4: Distribute Damage  
  
- Combat Roll: 1d6 (rolled a 4) + Combat Modifier (-1) = 3  
- **Result:** Positive total (3), so the enemies receive 3 points of damage.  
  
### Enemy Status  
  
- Goblin Hit Points: 8 (starting HP)  
- After Damage: 5 - 3 = 2 HP remaining  
  
### Step 5: Continuing Combat or Retreating  
  
- The party decides to Fight On.   
- Each member takes 1 damage (due to the rule in Step 5).  
- Repeat Step 4.  
  
### Next Round  
  
- Another Combat Roll: 1d6 (rolled a 5) + Combat Modifier (-1) = 4  
- **Result:** Again, a positive total (4), so the enemies receive 4 points of damage.  
- Goblin Hit Points: 2 (remaining HP)  
- After Damage: 2 - 4 = -2 HP (enemies defeated)  
  
### Step 6: Loot Collection  
  
- Loot Roll: 1d6 (rolled a 3) + Loot (assume +2) - 4 = 1  
- The party gets 1 Loot Die to use on the Loot Table.  
  
### Loot Acquisition  
  
- The party rolls the Loot Die (rolled a 4) and consults the Loot Table to collect their rewards.  
  
### Conclusion  
  
- The party successfully defeats the goblins and acquires loot from the encounter. They assess their remaining HP and decide whether to continue exploring or rest and recuperate.  
- Combat is deadly, so unless the party presses the issue enemies are happy to avoid the danger. However, no risk, no reward, and not glory.
