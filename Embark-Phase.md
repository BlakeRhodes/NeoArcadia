# Embark Phase    
Previous: [Prepare Phase](./Prepare-Phase.html)    
    
## Step 1: Scouting    
    
Scouting allows the party to assess their destination and better control their encounters there.    
- **Scouting Roll:** Roll 2d6 against the hex's Scout Difficulty.    
- Some characters, such as [Scouts](./Scouts.html), may modify this roll with their skills.    
- **Scouting Bonus:** Roll - Scout Difficulty.    
- If the Scouting Bonus is positive, the scouting is successful, and the party may use this bonus when rolling for encounters.    
    
## Step 2: Arrive    
    
Move the party marker to the destination hex.    
    
## Step 3: Begin Construction    
    
The party may begin construction on a [Civil Project](./Civil-Project.html).     
    
### Special Rule - Lay Low    
    
The party can wait when they are not yet ready to start construction on a Civic Project. While laying low if the party made their Scouting Roll they can skip the rest of their turn. During their next Prepare Phase can not choose a tile to move to.
