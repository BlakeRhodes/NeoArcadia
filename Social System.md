# Social System
## Components

2. **Rumors:** Gleaning knowledge about distant hexes.
3. **Information:** Obtaining specific details that can unlock events or secrets.
4. **Reputation:** A measure of how players are perceived, affecting their interactions.


## Trade

 - Players can trade items at hexes that have markets during the [Prepare Phase](Prepare%20Phase.md)
 -  Players can trade items with other parties if they are both on the same hex. This can be done during any phase. If the parties belong to different players both player must be present at time of the trade.

## Rumors

- Each rumor is keyed to a specific hex. Not every hex has a rumor, but the interesting ones do.
- Rumors may not always be accurate; there's a chance of misleading information.
- Parties may share rumors with other parties, even if they are in different hexes.
- Players may choose to "spread" the rumor by turning the rumor card face up for other players to see. This is done during the [Prepare Phase](Prepare%20Phase.md)

## Information

- Information is more reliable and specific than rumors.
- It can be used to unlock special encounters, discover hidden treasures, or solve puzzles.
- Unlike rumors, information can not be shared, but it can be traded if two parities are on the same square.

## Persuasion

- A [Persuasion Roll ](Persuasion%20Roll.md)maybe required in an encounter.
- [Persuasion Roll](Persuasion%20Roll.md): 2d6 + [Party's Reputation](Party's%20Reputation.md) - Difficulty
- Before the role any character may spend one Will Power to add one to the roll.
