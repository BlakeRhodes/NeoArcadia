## Components  
  
1. **Rumors:** Gathering insights about distant hexes.  
2. **Information:** Acquiring specific details to unlock events or secrets.  
3. **Reputation:** Reflects how parties are perceived, influencing their interactions.  
  
## Trade  
  
- Players can exchange items at hexes with markets during the [Prepare Phase](./Prepare%20Phase.html).  
- Players can trade items with other parties if they occupy the same hex. This can occur during any phase. For parties belonging to different players, both players must be present at the time of the trade.  
  
## Rumors  
  
- Each rumor is linked to a specific hex. Not every hex has a rumor, but the notable ones typically do.  
- Rumors may not always be accurate and could contain misleading information.  
- Parties have the option to share rumors with others, even in different hexes.  
- Players can choose to "spread" a rumor by placing the corresponding rumor card face up. This action is performed during the [Prepare Phase](./Prepare%20Phase.html).  
  
## Information  
  
- Information is typically more reliable and detailed than rumors.  
- It is used to unlock special encounters, find hidden treasures, or solve puzzles.  
- Information cannot be shared like rumors, but it can be traded between parties on the same square or sold at the [Flea Market](./Flea%20Market.html)  
  
## Persuasion  
  
- Encounters may require a [Persuasion Roll](./Persuasion%20Roll.html).  
- **[Persuasion Roll](./Persuasion%20Roll.html):** 2d6 + [Party's Reputation](./Party's%20Reputation.html) vs Difficulty.  
- Before the roll, any character can spend one Will Power point to add one to the result.
