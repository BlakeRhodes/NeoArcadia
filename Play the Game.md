# Play the Game

NeoArcadia is designed to be played over long periods of time with players coming and going creating a Continuous Play Experience. Imagine a game that evolves and grows, not just over hours, but over weeks, welcoming new players into its fold as they discover it. This is the Continuous Play Experience, a revolutionary approach to gaming that combines the charm of old-fashioned play-by-post war games with the dynamic interactivity of modern tabletop gaming.

**How It Works:**

- **Asynchronous Play:** The Continuous Play Experience thrives on flexibility. Players can join the game at any time, contributing at their own pace. This means the game is always active, always evolving, even when players are not physically present.
- **Open-Ended Narrative:** The game's story unfolds over weeks, influenced by the actions and decisions of current and new players. Each player's involvement shapes the course of the game, creating a rich, collaborative narrative tapestry.
- **Dynamic Integration of New Players:** Newcomers can easily join in without disrupting the flow. The game is designed to seamlessly incorporate new characters and perspectives, enriching the experience for everyone involved.
## Game Pieces

- **Map** - This is the visual representation of the play area.
- **Rumor Deck** - This is a stack of [Rumors](./Rumors.md) about the individual [Hexes](./Hexes.md) on the map.
- **Party Markers** - A object to mark where parties are in the play area.
- Hex Sheets - Details of each hex on the board, including any special rules and [Encounters](./Encounters.md). These should have the hex number on the back and only flipped over to be viewed when a party moves to the hex.
- **Party Sheets** - Details of each party used for record keeping.
- **Calendar Card** - A place to record the progression of game time and the current [Season](./Season.md) and [Weather Effects](./Weather%20Effects.md).
