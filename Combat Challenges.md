The true form of this AI is not bound by a physical body, its 'HP' a misleading concept, as it exists across networks and systems.  
  
- Instead of traditional combat, facing this Rogue AI is a battle of wits and wills, requiring parties to outmaneuver and outsmart it in a high-stakes game of digital cat and mouse.
