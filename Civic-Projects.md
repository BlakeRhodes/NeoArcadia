# Civic Projects    
    
In the ancient future, structures are not just physical constructions but embodiments of hope and progress. Here are some civic projects the Sky Captains of NeoArcadia have requested to improve life in the wastes.    
    
## Construction Rules    
    
To build a Civic Project, a party must gather the required resources and bring them to the hex. Additionally, if the Civic Project involves constructing a building, the party must clear the hex before construction can begin. The standard construction process involves the following steps:    
    
1. **Scout**: The party must successfully scout the hex where they wish to build the Civic Project.    
       
2. **Encounter Resolution**: The party must confront and resolve all encounters in the hex to clear the area for building. The party may choose the order that they resolve the encounters. This step ensures the safety and security of the construction site.    
    
3. **Resource Allocation**: The party must use all the gathered resources needed to construct the Project.    
    
4. **Construction Complete**: Once the construction is finished, the party updates the hex sheet with the new Project and removes the encounter table, signifying the completion of the construction.    
    
#### Special Rule - Pooling Resources    
    
In some cases, multiple parties may decide to collaborate and pool their resources for larger construction projects or to overcome significant challenges, such as clearing a particularly difficult hex. When parties decide to collaborate, they must agree on the following:    
    
1. **Resource Sharing**: Parties agree on how to split the cost of resources for the construction project.    
    
2. **Cooperative Effort in Encounters**: Parties take turns or work together to confront and resolve encounters in the hex. This cooperative effort is crucial in preparing the hex for the construction of larger or more complex projects.    
    
3. **Joint Construction Effort**: After clearing the hex and gathering the necessary resources, all parties involved contribute to the construction process of the Civic Project.    
    
The pooling of resources and cooperative effort can lead to the successful completion of grander and more ambitious projects, benefiting all parties involved.
