# 0106 - Farmland -  Golden Fields

**Harvest Bargain**  
  
If the check succeeds the farmers let slip their secret sauce, gain 2 gems to keep your mouth shut, or gain Information: Golden Fields KIlls People! You can turn this information in at NeoArcadia for 500 Gold at the General Goods Market.  
  
**Mourning Farmer**  
  
If the check succeeds you realize this is a horrible lie to set the party up for an ambush and can avoid the tricky situation. Otherwise, the party spends one SP to escape the ambush and a fate of being fertilizer.  
  
**Biomatter Harvest**  
  
If the party takes part in the ritual, lose 1 WP and refresh your rations. If the party contains a scout with Don't Ask . . ., they may skip the WP loss, as they have ate worse.  
  
**Special Loot:** If the party defeats the farmers, they find 1 Ancient Tech, and 2d6 Spices, 1d6 Ale, 2d6 Salt, and 3d6 Timber.  
  
**Special Encounter - Bigger Fish to Fry**  
  
Make a Scouting Roll, if successful the party finds a recent journal in the discarded possessions of less wary adventurers. The journal describes the Braying-Leviathan and several pages of research on the topic of Leviathans with speculation on their origins. If the Skycaptain had not put out a call you would think this was all some horrible fiction.
