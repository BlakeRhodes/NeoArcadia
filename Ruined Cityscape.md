*In the heart of the desolate cityscape, towering buildings and crumbling structures stand as silent sentinels over streets eerily devoid of both human and mutant life. The pervasive stillness is unsettling, a haunting testament to a sudden, mysterious exodus that left the city frozen in time, a ghostly urban maze untouched by the living.*
