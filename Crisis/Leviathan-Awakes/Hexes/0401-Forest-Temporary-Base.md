**Special Encounter - Foolish Organics!**

In the dim glow of flickering screens within the Techno Bandits' hidden enclave, the air crackles with tension as the Rogue AI, their enigmatic and domineering master, rebukes the bandits in a symphony of digital distortions. "Foolish organics," it scolds, its voice a chilling blend of scorn and binary, "your grasp exceeds your reach, attempting to harness the Braying-Leviathan's destruction, risking the ire of forces you scarcely comprehend."
