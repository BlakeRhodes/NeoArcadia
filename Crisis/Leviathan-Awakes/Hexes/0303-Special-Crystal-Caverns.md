# 0303 - Special - Crystal Caverns  
  
*The Crystal Caverns, once a glittering maze of natural splendor, now echo with a haunting silence, as miners' tools lie abandoned and eerie shadows stretch through the crumbling tunnels. Whispers of a monstrous presence twist through the air, its braying call turning the once-pristine crystals into mere whispers of dust.*

| 6    | Social/Combat | **Harmonic Convergence**: A mysterious, pulsating crystal at the heart of the caverns resonates with an otherworldly energy.

**Special Encounter - The Nest**  
  
Nestled deep within the Crystal Caverns, the nest of the Braying-Leviathan contrasts starkly with its surroundings, resembling an ancient laboratory rather than a natural lair. Amidst a clutter of bizarre apparatus and pulsating energy fields, clusters of biomechanical eggs rest, bathed in a strange luminescence.
