# Prepare Phase

## 1. **Play or Pass**

If they player does not wish to play this round, or any number of upcoming round simply skip that player. This could occur when a player is taking a phone call, grabbing a snack, going out of town for the weekend, etc. This allow for the game to progress when real life gets in the way.

## 2. Select Party or Build a Party

A player without a party uses the [Party Creation](./Party%20Creation.md) rules to create one. This can occur when first starting the game, or when all of the player's previous parties have died. This is the whole of that player's turn.

A player who has one or more parties selects one to activate this turn.

--BETA--
If a player has a Guild House they may pay to recruit a new party to join their guild. Counts as a party activation for the guild.
Guild House allow players to activate multiple parties based on their organization level. These parties share Phases and Steps.

## 3. Planning

Choose which hex the active party will travel to from the adjacent hexes. This is the destination hex. The party does not move there yet and is still considered to be at its current location. 

### Special Rule: Lost

A party that is [Lost](Lost.md) do not choose which tile they move to, instead they role 1d6 and move to a random adjacent hex. The party is no longer lost after this turn.

## 4. Provisioning

The party may trade at any [Market](./Market.md) they have access to in their current hex. The market is a table of goods and what they trade for. This can be different for each market and substitutions are not allowed. The party may make any number of trades. 

### Special Rule: Ale is Always a Good Investment

Parties that do not have any items to trade in the market can always buy Ale.
- Buy Price: 2 gold for 6 Ale
- Sell Price: 5 Ale for 2 gold (Somebody drank number 6)

### Special Rule: Market Collapse

If the player can performs a loop of trades that leaves them with more resources of the same type overall than what they started with, in other words producing infinite goods, that market collapses and the player receives 10 PP to distribute to their characters. The market is then closed and the economy is in shambles. Thanks Capitalism.

## 5. Character Abilities and Spreading Rumors

Characters that have abilities that can be used in the Prepare Phase now can use those abilities in the order the player wishes.

Parties wanting to spread rumors may leave their rumor card face up for other players to read.
