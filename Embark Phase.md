# Embark Phase  
Previous: [Prepare Phase](./Prepare%20Phase.html)  
  
## **Step 1: Forage**  
  
Before leaving for their destination, the party may choose to forage in the current hex. This provides an opportunity to recover supplies and extend travel capabilities.  
  
- **[Forage Roll](./Forage%20Roll.html):** Roll 2d6 against the current hex's Forage Difficulty.  
- Certain characters, like [Hunters](./Hunters.html), may modify this roll with their skills.  
- **[Yield](./Yield.html):** Roll +1 - Forage Difficulty.  
- If the yield is less than 1, foraging fails. Otherwise, the party gains that many rations and water.  
  
## **Step 2: Consuming Rations and Water**  
  
Each hex has a Travel Value that determines the amount of rations and water **each** character consumes while traveling. Use the Travel Value of the destination hex to calculate the party's consumption.  
  
### Special Rule: Insufficient Supplies  
  
- If there are not enough rations for the whole party, choose which characters will not eat. These characters will lose one stamina point and consume an additional unit of water.  
- If there is insufficient water for the whole party, decide which characters will not drink. These characters will lose 2 stamina points. If this would reduce their stamina to below zero, it remains at zero.  
  
## **Step 3: Scouting**  
  
Scouting allows the party to assess their destination and better control their encounters there.  
- **[Scouting Roll](./Scouting%20Roll.html):** Roll 2d6 against the hex's Scout Difficulty.  
- Some characters, such as [Scouts](./Scouts.html), may modify this roll with their skills.  
- **[Scouting Bonus](./Scouting%20Bonus.html):** Roll - Scout Difficulty.  
- If the Scouting Bonus is positive, the scouting is successful, and the party may use this bonus when rolling for encounters.  
  
## Step 4: Arrive  
  
Move the party marker to the destination hex.
