# Embark Phase
Previous: [Prepare Phase](./Prepare%20Phase.html)

## **Step 2: Forage

The party may Forage in the current hex before leaving for their destination. This gives the party a chance to recover supplies and travel further.

- **[Forage Roll](./Forage%20Roll.html):** Roll 2d6 vs the current hex's Forage Difficulty.
- Some characters may modify this roll with their skills, such as [Hunters](./Hunters.html)
- [Yield](./Yield.html): Roll +1 - Forage Difficulty
- If the yield is less than 1, foraging failed, otherwise the party gets that many rations and water.

## **Step 3: Consuming Rations and Water**

Each hex has a Travel Value, this is the amount of rations and water **each** character consumes while traveling. Use the Travel Value of the destination hex to see how many rations and water the party consumes on the way

### Special Rule: Insufficient Supplies

If there is not enough rations for the whole party, choose which characters will not eat and they spend one stamina point and consume an additional water.

If there is not enough water for the whole party, choose which characters will not drink and they spend 2 stamina points. If this would put them below 0 stamina, they remain at 0.
   
## **Step 4: Scouting**

Scouting allows the characters to check out their destination and have more control over what they encounter there.
- [Scouting Roll](./Scouting%20Roll.html): Roll 2d6 against the hex's Scout Difficulty.
- Some characters may modify this roll with their skills, such as [Scouts](./Scouts.html)
- [Scouting Bonus](./Scouting%20Bonus.html): Roll - Scout Difficulty
- If the Scouting Bonus is positive, then the Scouting was successful and the party may use this bonus when rolling for encounters.

## Step 5: Arrive

Move the party marker to the destination hex.
