## Step 1: Scouting  
  
Scouting allows the party to assess their destination and better control their encounters there.  
- **[Scouting Roll](./Scouting%20Roll.html):** Roll 2d6 against the hex's Scout Difficulty.  
- Some characters, such as [Scouts](./Scouts.html), may modify this roll with their skills.  
- **[Scouting Bonus](./Scouting%20Bonus.html):** Roll - Scout Difficulty.  
- If the Scouting Bonus is positive, the scouting is successful, and the party may use this bonus when rolling for encounters.  
  
## Step 2: Arrive  
  
Move the party marker to the destination hex.
