Previous: [Encounter Phase](./Encounter-Phase.md)    
    
## Step 1: Death    
    
- If the party is at 0 HP roll 1d6 if the roll is 4+ nothing happens otherwise chose a character to become a corpse.    
- **Exhaustion Check:** If the party is at 0 stamina roll 2d6; on an 11 or 12, choose a character to become a corpse.    
- Corpses are no longer considered characters and do not contribute to the party. Not even Linus can break the cycle of death. Pour out an ale for your fallen friend.    
    
## Step 2: Despair    
    
- If the Party is at 0 WP, choose a character to despair.    
- The character can not use skills until WP is increased to at least 1.    
    
## Step 3: Recover Hit Points    
    
The party recovers 2 HP    
    
## Step 4: Recover Stamina    
    
- Two characters must be selected for standing watch. The dangers of the Ancient Future do not rest. If the watch can not be filled, the party is slain in the night.    
- The party recovers one stamina.    
    
## Step 5: Recover Resourcefulness    
    
- Recover 1 RP    
- The party may then convert Luck Points into Resourcefulness.    
- Luck Points, once spent, are not recovered, unless a stroke of luck occurs...
