# Recovery Phase  
Previous: [Encounter Phase](./Encounter%20Phase.html)  
  
## Step 1: Recover Hit Points  
  
- Each character may regain Hit Points equal to their stamina by spending 1 R or 1 Medicinal Herb.  
- Healing skills from certain classes can be used after deciding to spend R for healing.  
  
## Step 2: Recover Stamina  
  
- Two characters must be selected for standing watch. The dangers of the Ancient Future do not rest.  
- All characters not on watch regain 1 stamina.  
  
## Step 3: Death  
  
- Characters with Hit Points at zero are considered dead and become corpses.  
- Characters at zero stamina must undertake an Exhaustion Check.  
- **Exhaustion Check:** Roll 2d6; on an 11 or 12, the character survives, otherwise, they die and become a corpse.  
- Corpses are no longer considered characters.  
  
## Step 4: Despair  
  
- Characters with zero Will Power enter a state of Despair and cannot use skills.  
- Any character can transfer one of their Will Power points to a character in Despair.  
  
## Step 5: Recover Resourcefulness  
  
- One character may recover 1 R.  
- Characters may then convert Luck Points into Resourcefulness.  
- Luck Points, once spent, are not recovered, unless a stroke of luck occurs...
