# Crisis! Leviathan Awakes  
  
In the depths of NeoArcadia, a tremor passes through the land â€“ a sign that the ancient Braying-Leviathan, a creature of myth and terror, has awakened from its ageless slumber. Its haunting bray resonates across the land, sowing fear and weakening the will of the bravest adventurers. "Leviathan Awakes" is a Crisis! event that tests the mettle and strategy of all who dare to confront this colossal beast.  
  
## Overview of the Crisis! Event: Leviathan Awakes  
  
- **The Wager:** The awakening of the Leviathan comes with the destruction of one Trading Post, a valuable resource hub for adventurers. Parties wager the outpost against the potential rewards of subduing the Braying-Leviathan. Choose a hex with an outpost and remove the outpost and place the Braying-Leviathan and reveal the Special Encounter sheet for it.  
  
- **Rumors abound:** Shuffle the rumors for this crisis and draw one per player. Then shuffle the remaining rumors into the Rumor Deck.  
  
- **Update Hex Sheets**: Add the hex sheets to the binder. Add to the General Goods at NeoArcadia quickfire. It sells for 50 gold per liter.  
  
- **Initial Threat:** The Braying-Leviathan's awakening is marked by a powerful bray that echoes through the surrounding hexes, parties within two hexes of the Leviathan at the beginning of the crisis lose 1 WP. Parties that are with in one hex of the Leviathan at the beginning of the Environment turn lose 1 WP.  
  
- **Leviathan's Presence:** The Braying-Leviathan manifests at the location of the destroyed trading post, becoming a formidable presence on the map that demands immediate attention.  
  
## Rules for the Leviathan  
  
### Special Rule: Mobile Threat  
  
The Braying-Leviathan moves across the hex map of NeoArcadia during the environment phase, following a set of specific rules that dictate its behavior:  
  
1. **Lure Success:** If a party successfully executes a Lure action, the Leviathan moves one hex toward the party. This strategic maneuver allows parties to guide the beast's movements, potentially steering it away from critical areas or setting up an ambush.  
     
2. **Attraction to Structures:** In the absence of a successful Lure, the Leviathan instinctively moves toward the nearest building within three hexes. This behavior reflects its destructive nature, targeting the remnants of civilization and resources crucial to the adventurers. If it end's the environment turn on a hex with a building, that building is destroyed.  
     
3. **Random Movements:** If there are no buildings within three hexes and no successful Lure has been executed, the Leviathan moves randomly. This unpredictability adds an element of chaos and urgency to the Crisis! event, requiring parties to be adaptable and vigilant.  
  
### Special Rule: Lure the Beast!  
  
The Braying-Leviathan can be lured to the party with the expenditure of some resources. Seemingly attracted to destruction, the burning of a liter of quickfire has a chance to attract the creature.  
  
 1. Make a Scout Roll against the current hex and spend one liter of quick fire. You may spend additional liters to add plus one to the role. Subtract one for each hex between the party and the Leviathan.  
   
 2. If successful the party has Lured the Leviathan.
