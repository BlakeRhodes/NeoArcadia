## Step 1: Regular Encounters    
    
- Roll 1d6 You may add or subtract your Scouting Bonus after rolling. If doing so would put your result above 6 or below 1 use the closest number instead.    
    
## Step 2: Resolve Encounter    
    
Encounters challenge the party and tax their resources. Sometimes it is better to avoid danger, but nothing risked nothing gained.     
    
Combat is common as the Ancient Future is a dangerous place. Use the [Combat System](./Combat-System.html) to slay your foes!    
    
## Step 3: Special Encounters    
    
Some hexes have Special Encounters, these are encounters unique to the hex and have their own rules for resolution as recorded on the Hex Sheet.
