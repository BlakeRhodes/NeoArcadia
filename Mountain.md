# Mountain

High in the mountains of rubble, remnants of the colossal hive cities' collapse, the air carries a distinct, pungent mix of rust and decay, a testament to the long-forgotten urban sprawls. It's tinged with a sharp, metallic scent, mingling with the faint, earthy aroma of ancient concrete and steel slowly surrendering to nature's embrace.
