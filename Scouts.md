# Scouts  
  
In the vast expanses of the Ancient Future, Scouts stand out as the quintessential navigators and explorers, many of whom honed their skills in the tumultuous times of the Last War. These born adventurers are driven by an insatiable curiosity, not only to uncover hidden riches but also to unearth distant memories and forgotten tales that lie scattered across the land.   
  
With an innate proficiency in charting unexplored territories and deciphering cryptic maps, Scouts possess a unique blend of practical survival skills and a deep yearning for discovery. They are adept at reading the subtle signs of nature and unraveling the secrets of the most treacherous landscapes.   
  
However, despite their bravery and expertise, Scouts harbor a peculiar and intense hatred for bugs. Some say this is a lasting legacy of the Last War, but most scouts are unwilling to speak of the exact reason. Those who do tell tales that are as unbelievable as they are grisly.
