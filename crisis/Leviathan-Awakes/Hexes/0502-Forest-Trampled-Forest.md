**Leviathan's Relic: Heart of the Wild**

The Leviathan's Relic is an artifact pulsating with an ancient, untamed energy. This luminescent core, cradled within a web of intertwining tentacles and fragmented crystals, seems to resonate with the very essence of the Braying-Leviathan.

- Upon activation, the Heart of the Wild emits a deep, resonant thrum, akin to the Leviathan's haunting bray, but harnessed and controlled. The party may instill a sense of unease and fear in enemies, reducing their Impact by 3 for the duration of the encounter. After use role 1d6 on a one it breaks, turning into 2 Ancient Tech.
