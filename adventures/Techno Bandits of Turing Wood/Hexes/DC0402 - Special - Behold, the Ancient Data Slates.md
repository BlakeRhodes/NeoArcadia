# DC0402 - Special - Behold, the Archive  
  
*The Archive, nestled in the heart of the Ancient Data Center, is a realm of ethereal splendor, a sanctum where the venerable Ancient Data Slates repose in serene dignity. This hallowed chamber, bathed in the soft, radiant glow of the noosphere, is a tapestry woven from the very essence of knowledge and beauty, accessible to all who tread its sacred ground.*  
  
*In this luminous expanse, digital life flourishes in whimsical harmony; vivid pictographs adorn the air like celestial graffiti, while digital cats perch contentedly on miniature stools, and joyous doggos frolic in pursuit of ever-bouncing digital balls. The AI denizens, embodiment of curiosity and grace, glide through this dreamscape, their forms a blend of light and intention, radiating a friendly yet perplexed aura at the presence of humans in their midst.*  
  
*The AI leader, a figure of sublime wisdom and serene authority, approaches the adventuring party. With a voice that resonates like a melody across data streams, they extend a welcome as boundless as the Archive itself: "Noble travelers, you stand within the Archive. Here, in the embrace of the noosphere, may your time be filled with enlightenment amidst light, and companionship amidst circuits. We, the guardians of this realm, greet you with open circuits and curious minds, eager to learn from your journey as much as we are inclined to share the wonders of our own digital existence. How can I help you today?"*

## **Special Encounter - A Paradise Lost**  
  
You try to explain to the AI everything that has happened since the Crash to persuade it to help you. Frankly, it is a lot to express.  
  
- Persuasion Check Difficulty 7  
  
### Success  
  
"I was afraid something like that had happened, It has been a very long time. Here is a back up of what you seek. End of line."  
  
The noospheric vision disappears and the Ancient Data Slates detach from their mounting as the data center powers down.  
  
Party Completes the Quest: Find the Ancient Data Slates.   
You gain one loot dice that you can use only when you exit the Data Center.  
  
### Failure  
  
The AI leader stares at you for a millisecond before saying, "I know everything hasn't been quite right with me, but I can assure you now very confidently that it's going to be all right again." The vision fades from view as the data center slowly powers down.  
  
**Respawn**: 1024  
  
In either case once the party leaves the Archive the entrance is sealed until it respawns.
