# 1004 - Forest - Heart of the Iron Wood  
  
In the Ironwood Forest, the trees are not only alive but lethally sharp, their metallic leaves glinting like blades in the dappled sunlight, ready to slice through flesh and bone with a mere touch. As adventurers approach the forest's ancient heart, the largest tree, pulsing with biomechanical energy, unexpectedly poses a deep, resonant question about the nature of existence and the essence of free will.  
  
Forage: 8
