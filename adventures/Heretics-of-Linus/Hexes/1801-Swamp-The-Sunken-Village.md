*As you wade through the dense, murky swamps, your boots finally catch on something solid. Regaining your footing, you gaze forward to discover the remnants of a village, partially engulfed by the swamp. The wooden structures, spared from complete decay by moisture and rot, suggest they have only recently succumbed.*
