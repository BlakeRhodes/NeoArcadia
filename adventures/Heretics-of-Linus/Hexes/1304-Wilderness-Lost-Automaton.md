*A lost automaton traverses the wild, overgrown landscapes of a world long forgotten by its creators. Clutched in its metallic grasp are a handful of eggs, their shells infused with a soft, bioluminescent glow, harboring the seeds of life for a new, mysterious species. This automaton, a fusion of ancient technology and organic resilience, follows the call of an ancient programming, guiding it through dense forests and across rushing rivers, on a quest to find a hidden enclave where these precious charges can safely hatch. Amidst the wilderness, this solitary guardian moves with a single-minded purpose, protecting the fragile hope of renewal.*

**Special Encounter - Not Lost, but Seeking**
- The party may choose to follow the automaton.
- If they do, the party is Lost, however the automaton will act as a member of the party.
- If the party follows the automaton for 5 turns they will see the automaton finally place the eggs in a safe place. The automaton then becomes a permanent member of the party.
