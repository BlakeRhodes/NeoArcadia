Light both ends of the first flux cord and one end of the second. When the first flux cord has burnt out, light the other end of the second.

Since half an hour has passed when the first cord is burnt out the second cord has been burning from one end for 30 minutes, it would normally have 30 minutes left to burn. However, by lighting the other end as well, it will now burn out in 15 minutes because it's burning from both ends.
