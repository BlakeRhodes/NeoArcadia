# 0107 - Swamp - Ruins of Echofall  
  
*In this vast swamp, the air is filled with a symphony of life — the chorus of frogs, the buzz of insects, and the distant calls of hidden creatures — all resonating above the subtle, dissonant gurgles and echoes from the decaying waste processing plants. These sounds mingle eerily, creating a haunting acoustic tapestry that tells a story of nature's resilience overshadowed by the remnants of a once-polluting past.*

*In the haunted mists of an age-old swamp, spectral Scouts clash with colossal ancient swamp bugs, their ethereal arrows whistling through the air as they desperately avoid their many-legged foes. This eerie battle, a dance of ghostly figures and monstrous insects, unfolds with a surreal grace, echoing with the sounds of a long-forgotten war and the Scouts' unnerved whispers.*
