# 1004 - Forest - Heart of the Iron Wood  
  
*In the Ironwood Forest, the trees are not only alive but lethally sharp, their metallic leaves glinting like blades in the dappled sunlight, ready to slice through flesh and bone with a mere touch. As adventurers approach the forest's ancient heart, the largest tree, pulsing with biomechanical energy, unexpectedly poses a deep, resonant question about the nature of existence and the essence of free will.*
