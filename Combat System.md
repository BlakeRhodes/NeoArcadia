# Combat System  
  
The combat revolves around a 2d6 roll, influenced by each party member's combat modifier, the enemy's strength, and is further modified by the 'Edge' rule in specific scenarios. For an example of combat take a look at the [Sample Combat Play-by-Play](./Sample%20Combat%20Play-by-Play.html)  
## **Step 1: Calculate Party Impact**  
  
- **Party Impact:** Sum the combat modifiers of each character. This sum is the Party Impact.  
  
## **Step 2: Calculate Combat Modifier**  
  
- Subtract the encounter's [Enemy Impact](./Enemy%20Impact.html) from the [Party Impact](./Party%20Impact.html). The result is the Combat Modifier.  
  
## **Step 3: [Edge Factor](./Edge%20Factor.html)**  
  
- **Scouting Advantage:** If the party has successfully scouted and used their [Scouting Bonus](./Scouting%20Bonus.html), add an extra 1d6 to the combat roll (resulting in a 3d6 roll).  
- **Surprise Disadvantage:** If ambushed, subtract 1d6 from the combat roll (resulting in a 1d6 roll).  
   - Note: If both conditions apply, they cancel each other out, resulting in a standard 2d6 roll.  
  
## Step 4: Distribute Damage  
  
- Roll 2d6, apply the Edge Factor, and add the Combat Modifier.  
- **Results:**   
   - A positive total inflicts damage on the enemies, reducing their hit points. When enemy hit points reach zero, the party wins and may roll on the loot table.  
   - A negative total signifies damage to the party. The player decides how to distribute this damage among the characters, ensuring that no character receives more damage than their remaining hit points. If all characters reach zero hit points and damage remains, it is ignored.  
  
## **Step 5: Continuing Combat or Retreating**  
  
- **Fight On:** The party may choose to continue combat, incurring one damage per member, then repeat Step 4. If all characters reach zero hit points, the party must retreat.  
- **Retreat:** The party may retreat to avoid further combat. In this case, they forfeit any chance to earn loot.  
  
### Special Rule: Impact of Injuries  
  
- When a character's hit points drop to zero, they no longer contribute to the Party Impact, reflecting their incapacitated state.  
   - Note: A character with zero hit points is not dead yet but is grievously wounded.  
  
## Step 6: Loot Collection  
  
- **[Loot Dice](./Loot%20Dice.html):** Roll 1d6 + Loot - 4.  
- If the result is positive, the party receives that many Loot Dice to use on the Loot Tables. These dice must be used immediately, or they are forfeited.  
- **Loot Tables:** Choose a Loot Table and decide how many Loot Dice to roll.  
- **Roll for Loot:** Roll the Loot Dice and sum the results. Consult the table to determine the loot acquired.  
  
Players may group these rolls as they wish. For example, if the party has 4 Loot Dice, the player may roll each individually, combine two dice into one roll twice, or even use all four for a chance at obtaining superior loot!
