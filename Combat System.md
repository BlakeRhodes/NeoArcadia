# Combat System  
  
The combat revolves around a 2d6 roll, influenced by each party member's combat modifier, the enemy's strength, and is further modified by the 'Edge' rule in specific scenarios. For an example of combat take a look at the [Sample Combat Play-by-Play](./Sample%20Combat%20Play-by-Play.html)  
## Step 1: Calculate Party Impact  
  
- **Party Impact:** Sum the combat modifiers of each character. This sum is the Party Impact.  
  
## Step 2: Calculate Combat Modifier  
  
- Subtract the encounter's Enemy Impact from the Party Impact. The result is the Combat Modifier.  
  
## Step 3: Edge Factor  
  
- **Scouting Advantage:** If the party has successfully scouted, add an extra 1d6 to the combat roll (resulting in a 3d6 roll).  
- **Surprise Disadvantage:** If ambushed, subtract 1d6 from the combat roll (resulting in a 1d6 roll).  
   - Note: If both conditions apply, they cancel each other out, resulting in a standard 2d6 roll.  
  
## Step 4: Time to Tussle  
  
- Roll 2d6, apply the Edge Factor, and add the Combat Modifier.  
- **Results:**   
   - A positive total inflicts damage on the enemies, reducing their hit points. When enemy hit points reach zero, the party wins and may roll on the loot table.  
   - A negative total signifies damage to the party, lose that much HP  
  
## Step 5: Continuing Combat or Retreating  
  
- **Fight On:** The party may choose to continue combat, spend one SP, then repeat Step 4. If the party has reached zero hit points, the party must retreat.  
- **Retreat:** The party may retreat to avoid further combat. In this case, they forfeit any chance to earn loot.  
  
## Step 6: Loot Collection  
  
If an encounter provides a Loot number, then the party can get some loot.  
  
- Loot Roll: Roll 1d6 - 4 + Loot Bonus  
- This is the number of Loot Dice the Party Receives  
  
### Special Rule: Strip It Bare  
  
Nothing goes to waste in the wastes, or so the saying goes. Resourceful adventurers can get some value out of anything.   
  
- If your Loot Roll is 0 or less, spend 1 RP and you get one Loot Dice.  
  
Players may group these rolls as they wish. For example, if the party has 4 Loot Dice, the player may roll each individually, combine two dice into one roll twice, or even use all four for a chance at obtaining superior loot!
