# Combat System

The combat centers around a 2d6 roll, influenced by each party member's combat modifier, enemy strength, and modified by the 'Edge' rule in certain scenarios.

## **Step 1: Calculate Party Impact**

- **Party Impact:** Sum each characters combat modifier. This is the Party Impact

## **Step 2: Calculate Combat Modifier

- Subtract the encounters [Enemy Impact](./Enemy%20Impact.html) from the [Party Impact](./Party%20Impact.html). This is the Combat Modifier.

## **Step 3: [Edge Factor](Edge%20Factor.html)**

- **Scouting Advantage:** If the party successfully scouted and used their [Scouting Bonus](./Scouting%20Bonus.html), add an extra 1d6 to the combat roll (resulting in a 3d6 roll).
- **Surprise Disadvantage:** If ambushed, subtract 1d6 from the combat roll (resulting in a 1d6 roll).
Note: if both are true they cancel each other out resulting in a roll of 2d6

## Step 4: Distribute Damage

- Roll 2d6 modified by the Edge Factor and add the Combat Modifier
- **Results** 
   - A positive total means damage inflicted on the enemies reducing enemy hit points. When this number reaches zero, the party wins and will get to roll on the loot table.
   - A negative total signifies damage to distribute to the party. The player decides how to distribute the damage among the characters. No character be given more damage than they have hit points. If all characters are at zero hit points and damage remains, it is ignored.

## **Step 5: Continuing Combat or Retreating**

- **Fight On:** The party can opt to continue the combat. Doing so results in each member taking one damage then repeat Step 4. If all characters are at zero hit points the party must retreat.

- **Retreat:** The party can retreat if they do not wish to continue the battle. They do not get a chance to earn loot.

### Special Rule Impact of Injuries

- When a character's hit points reach zero, their contribution to the Party Impact is removed, reflecting their weakened state.

Note: A Character with zero hit points is not dead yet, but they are grievously wounded.

## Step 6: Loot Collection

- [Loot Dice](Loot%20Dice.html): Roll 1d6 + Loot - 4
- If this number is positive, the party gets that many Loot Dice to use on the Loot Tables. These dice must be used now, or they are lost.
- **Loot Tables:** Choose a Loot Table and the number of Loot Dice to roll.
- **Roll for Loot:** Roll the Loot Dice and sum the result. Consult the table and collect your loot.

Players may group these rolls however they wish. For example if they party has 4 Loot Dice, the player may roll each individually, combine two dice into one roll twice, or even use them all for a chance at some super loot!
