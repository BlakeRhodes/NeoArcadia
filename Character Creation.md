#### Step 1: Choose a Character Type  
  
- Select from Fighter, Hunter, Priest, Rogue, or Bard.  
  
#### Step 2: Allocate Power Points (PP)  
  
- Determine the available PP based on the party size (4, 5, or 6 members).  
  
#### Step 3: Assign Stats  
  
- **Health Points (HP):** Base 4 + additional points at a cost of 1 PP per point.  
- **Stamina Points (SP):** Base 4 + additional points at 1 PP per 2 points.  
- **Willpower Points (WP):** Base 4 + additional points at 2 PP per point.  
- **Luck Points (LP):** Base 4 (not modifiable at character creation).  
- **Resourcefulness (R):** Base 3 + additional points at 3 PP per point.  
  
#### Step 4: Select Skills and Abilities  
  
- Choose from a list of skills and abilities specific to the character type.  
- Each skill/ability has a PP cost. More potent skills cost more.  
  
#### Stats  
  
1. **Health Points (HP):**  
   - Reflects the character's physical well-being.  
  
2. **Stamina Points (SP):**  
   - Indicates the character’s endurance for physical and strenuous activities.  
  
3. **Willpower Points (WP):**  
   - Measures mental fortitude and resilience.  
  
4. **Luck Points (LP):**  
   - Represents the character’s chance of favorable or unexpected outcomes.  
  
5. **Resourcefulness (R):**  
   - A measure of the character’s ability to make do with what they have.

#### Core Principles for Stats  
  
- **Attrition Over Time:** These stats decrease as characters face challenges. They recover slowly and can lead to character death if not managed well.  
- **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Engaging in high-risk situations might offer great rewards but at the cost of rapidly depleting these stats.  
- **Stat Restoration:** Players chances for full restoration are far and few between, thus is life in the Ancient Future.
