# Character Creation  
  
## Step 1: Choose a Character Type  
  
- Select from [Fighters](./Fighters.md), [Hunters](./Hunters.md), [Priests](./Priests.md), [Scouts](./Scouts.md)  
  
## Step 2: Select Skills  
  
- Choose from a list of skills and abilities specific to the character type.  
- Each skill/ability has a PP cost. More potent skills cost more.  
  
## Stats  
  
Each party member contributes not only different skill, but different stats to the parties total.  
  
1. **Combat Modifier (CM)** - This is how much the character contributes to the combat.  
  
2. **Health Points (HP)** -  Reflects the character's ability to take damage.  
  
3. **Stamina Points (SP)** - Indicates the character’s endurance for physical and strenuous activities.  
  
4. **Willpower Points (WP)** - The measure of mental fortitude and resilience.  
  
5. **Luck Points (LP)** - Represents the character’s chance of turning disaster into a great story.  
  
6. **Resourcefulness Points (RP)** - A measure of the characters ability to solve difficult problems.  
  
### Special Rule: Better Lucky, Than Dead  
  
- The Party may roll spend 1 LP to re-roll any single dice roll of a one. If that roll is a one it may be re-rolled for 1 LP, and so on until you run out of luck.
