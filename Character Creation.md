#### Core Principles for Stats

- **Attrition Over Time:** These stats should decrease as characters face challenges, recover slowly, and can lead to character death if not managed well.
- **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Engaging in high-risk situations might offer great rewards but at the cost of rapidly depleting these stats.
- **Character Replacement:** Given the high mortality rate, ensure that bringing in new characters is a streamlined process, keeping the game pace steady.
- **Stat Restoration:** Limited opportunities for full restoration, emphasizing the game's challenging nature.

- **WP:** 6 + Modifier based on character type or player choice
